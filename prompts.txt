# Expense Tracker Development Prompts and Results Summary

This document summarizes the iterative development process of the Expense Tracker application.

## 1. Initial Application Setup
**Prompt Summary:** Create a modern, premium expense tracker using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should allow adding expenses (date, category, amount, memo), listing them, and showing category-wise summaries. Use localStorage for data persistence.
**Result:** 
- `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js` created.
- Responsive design with HSL colors and glassmorphism.
- Functional CRUD operations for local expense management.

## 2. GitHub Integration and Deployment
**Prompt Summary:** Initialize a Git repository, push to GitHub, and set up automatic deployment via GitHub Pages.
**Result:**
- Repository initialized: `https://github.com/naoya0208/DAY4.git`
- GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) configured.
- Static site deployed to GitHub Pages.

## 3. Cloud Storage Integration (GAS)
**Prompt Summary:** Integrate Google Apps Script (GAS) to allow cloud synchronization with Google Sheets.
**Result:**
- `gas/Code.gs`: Backend logic for upload, download, and sync.
- CloudSync class in `main.js` to communicate with GAS.
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md`: Instructions for user deployment.

## 4. Debugging and Optimization
**Prompt Summary:** Fix "Error" during upload/sync.
**Result:**
- Identified CORS/Preflight issue with GAS Web Apps.
- Changed request `Content-Type` from `application/json` to `text/plain`.
- Enhanced error handling and diagnostics to identify spreadsheet configuration issues.

## 5. Final Verification
**Prompt Summary:** Help user find the synchronized data (user was looking at the wrong sheet).
**Result:**
- User confirmed data is correctly arriving in the "Expenses" tab of the spreadsheet.
- Implemented `SpreadsheetApp.flush()` for immediate data persistence.
